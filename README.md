Looking for value in the solar sector of the stock market

using module yahoo-finance

First i am taking the market value of a company and comparing that to the output of gigiwatts per year.

I haven't been able to find hard information on gigiwatt output for all companies.  Some companies like GLBL or TERP happen to list the information on their investor websites.  Bigger companies like SCTY or SUNE i haven't been able to find hard data besides PR that isn't the most reliable.

Using MarketCap/Gigiwatt we can get a scale of 1-100%.  100% being strong buy.

using Market Capital is a basic and unreliable way to find value.  Using thing like EV which is:

  EV = market value of common stock + market value of preferred equity + market value of debt + minority interest - cash and investments.

Let's see what we can do!
