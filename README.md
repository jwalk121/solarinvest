Looking for value in the solar sector of the stock market

First i am taking the market value of a company and comparing that to the output of gigiwatts per year.

I haven't been able to find hard information on gigiwatt output for all companies.  Some companies like GLBL or TERP happen to list the information on their investor websites.  Bigger companies like SCTY or SUNE i haven't been able to find hard data besides PR that isn't the most reliable.
